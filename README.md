### Remote

If a company is open to remote positions, please indicate so in the "Remote OK?" column. Also, please specify whether it's:

 - Remote (no exceptions), e.g. "Yes"
 - Remote within a given timezone or simliar, e.g. "Yes (within EU)"
 - Remote within a given country, e.g. "Yes (from the US)"
 - Hybrid remote, i.e. remote with some days on site, e.g. "Yes (hybrid)"
